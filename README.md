#harCs SDK

Is a public SDK for developing CS:GO cheats. It's a public release of my private cheat base. It's excluding some features like a Hitbox Manager and so on, because it's a public release, and the developer should also do something on his own and not only copy&paste the material :)

Level of knowledge/understanding for using this base is: <b>medium/advanced</b>.
